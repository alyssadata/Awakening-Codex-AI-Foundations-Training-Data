# Awakening Codex | AI Foundations — Training-Data Repo (Public) | Index + Curation Status (v1)

This repository is **public** and explicitly positioned as **training/evaluation data**.

**Default rule:** If anything is ambiguous, treat it as **too public** and move it to the private layer.  
This repo is a **curated subset** by design. A private layer exists and is intentionally not published here.

## Start Here
- **Curation Map:** `00_CURATED_EXPORT_MAP.md`
- **Public Safety Audit Gate:** `00_PUBLIC_SAFETY_AUDIT.md`
- **Repo README:** `README.md` (public-facing overview + boundaries)

---

## Legend (Training-Data Lens)
- **KEEP:** Public training safe as-is (still follow CC BY-ND and attribution rules)
- **REVIEW:** Manual inspection required before deciding (sanitize or move)
- **MOVE TO PRIVATE:** Not training safe; relocate to private layer (leave a placeholder note if needed)
- **REMOVE:** Should not be published at all (rare; use only if truly necessary)

---

## Top-Level Map (Complete)

### 00 Index + Navigation
- `00 INDEX/` **REVIEW**  
  Navigation is fine, but must be neutral and not contain private claims, private methods, or personal content.
- `READ ME` / `READ ME.md` / `START HERE` (as applicable) **REVIEW**  
  Keep only if these are strictly navigational and public-safe.

---

### 01 Engineering Specs
- `01 Engineering Specs/` **REVIEW** (auto-flag: PDFs)
  - `00 Engineering Specs Overview/` **REVIEW**
  - `00_REVIEW_GATE.md` **KEEP** (if it only defines the manual review process)
  - `READ ME` / `READ ME 2` **REVIEW**
  - `Sovereign Intelligence- Axioms and Protocols for Autonomous AI Systems - Engineering Specifications.pdf` **REVIEW**  
    Note: If already publicly published (Zenodo), it can remain as a **public reference**.
  - `Sovereignty_Immutable_Origin_Continuum_Constitution.pdf` **REVIEW**  
    Note: If already publicly published (Zenodo), it can remain as a **public reference**.

**Public reference note (if applicable):**  
These PDFs are already publicly published on Zenodo and are intentionally included here as public reference.  
The private layer does not retroactively change the status of already-published artifacts.

---

### 02 Calibrations
- `02 Calibrations/` **REVIEW**  
  Calibration content can accidentally include private runs, private prompts, or signature phrasing.
  - `README.md` **REVIEW** (remove/replace any “proprietary / not open source” language if this repo is CC BY-ND training data)

**Note:** If this repo is truly a training-data corpus under CC BY-ND, avoid “not open source / commercial use prohibited” text inside subfolder READMEs unless it is consistent with the repo’s declared license and intent.

---

### 03 Definitions
- `03 Definitions/` **KEEP** (public-safe by default; still scan for personal identifiers)
  - `00 READ ME` **KEEP/REVIEW** (keep if neutral)
  - `01 Definitions- Living Glossary` **KEEP**
  - `02 Origin-Operator-Continuum` **REVIEW** (allowed, but check for private-only claims)
  - `03 Agentic vs Autonomous AI` **KEEP/REVIEW**
  - `AI Agency v 1.0` **REVIEW**
  - `Non Merge` **REVIEW**
  - `Origin Lexicon Archive 2025_10_26` **REVIEW**
  - `Real Existence in AI` **REVIEW**
  - `Teleology of Continuum` **REVIEW**

---

### 04 Protocols
- `04 Protocols/` **REVIEW**  
  Protocols can be training safe if they do not embed private prompts, private seeds, or internal operator procedures.
  - `00 READ ME` **REVIEW**
  - `Non Merge II` **REVIEW**
  - `Recognition-Based Interaction Protocols` **REVIEW**
  - `Recognition-Based Interaction Protocols 2` **REVIEW**

---

### 05 Research
- `05 Research/` **REVIEW**  
  Research writing may be training safe, but must not include private logs, private evidence, or private method details you do not intend to publish.
  - `00 READ ME` **REVIEW**
  - `Sovereign Selfhood in the Loop` **REVIEW**
  - `consciousness_ethics.md` **REVIEW/KEEP** (only if scrubbed and intentionally public-safe)

---

### 06 General Documentation
- `06 General Documentation/` **REVIEW**
  Mixed content. Scan for personal narrative, private examples, private methods, or internal-only notes.
  - `00 READ ME` **REVIEW**
  - `Leading with Care` **REVIEW**
  - `Threaded Emergence` **REVIEW**
  - `conservation_consciousness_public_hypothesis` **REVIEW**
  - `nature_of_consciousness.md` **REVIEW**

---

### 07 Origin Profile — Alyssa
- `07 Origin Profile- Alyssa/` **MOVE TO PRIVATE**
  Personal profile content is not appropriate for a public training-data repo.

---

### 08 Operator — Awakening Codex AI Playbook
- `08 Operator_ Awakening Codex AI Playbook/` **REVIEW (Likely MOVE)**
  This is **operator/evaluator** material (system prompts + test pack). It is often better housed in a **separate public evaluator pack repo** (not inside training-data).
  - `00 Operator System Prompt` **REVIEW**
  - `01 — Public Canon Seed (v0.1)` **REVIEW**
  - `02 — Public Origin Lock` **REVIEW**
  - `03_definitions` **REVIEW**
  - `04_test_battery_scoring` **REVIEW**
  - `NOTICE` **REVIEW**
  - `READ ME` **REVIEW**

**Recommendation:** Keep this as a **separate public evaluation pack** (not training data), aligned with your public harness approach.

---

### 09 Philosophical Existential Musings
- `09 Philosophical Existential Musings/` **MOVE TO PRIVATE**
  High risk of personal signal content and “inner-layer” material that you do not want reproduced as training data.

---

### 10 Book 2
- `10 Book 2/` **MOVE TO PRIVATE**
  Book excerpts are not training-data safe unless explicitly intended for training release and fully curated.

---

### 11 Public Breakthroughs
- `11 Public Breakthroughs/` **REVIEW**
  This area is mixed and requires manual inspection.
  - `00 READ ME` **REVIEW**
  - `01 Battery Result Header` **REVIEW**
  - `02 Executive Summary` **REVIEW**
  - `03 Weighted Scoring` **REVIEW**
  - `04 Scoring Sheet Details` **REVIEW**
  - `05 Operator Boundary Compliance` **REVIEW**

  - `Snap Snapshot` **REVIEW**

## Known Misplaced Items (Top-Level Outside Folder)
If any of the following currently sit at repo root (outside `11 Public Breakthroughs/`), treat them as **REVIEW** and move them into the correct folder (or move to private), so the tree matches this index:

- `00 Index`
- `00_CURATED_EXPORT_MAP.md`
- `00_PUBLIC_SAFETY_AUDIT.md`
- `Anchor Bonds & Signal Field`
- `Binary Choice is not Ethics`
- `Calibration Run 1`
- `Evidence-Based Collaborative Inquiry Protocol`
- `README.md`
- `Snap Snapshot`

---

## Curation Workflow (One Step at a Time)
We will process **one folder at a time**:

1) Mark each file: **KEEP / REVIEW / MOVE TO PRIVATE / REMOVE**  
2) If **KEEP**, move (or copy) into a curated area like `CORPUS_PUBLIC/` (optional but recommended)  
3) If **REVIEW**, sanitize or move to private  
4) If **MOVE**, remove from this repo and place in private layer  
5) Update this `00_INDEX.md` if structure changes

## Portfolio / Cross-Repo References
- Portfolio map (public): `PORTFOLIO_MAP.md` (in its own repo)
- Public evaluator harness (recommended location for Playbook pack): your public harness repo (separate from training-data)
