# Researcher Profile — Alyssa

Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.

## Purpose

This folder documents Alyssa’s role as an independent researcher:
scope, methods, publication practice, and how claims are handled (verification, uncertainty, falsification).

It is separate from the Origin Profile. Origin defines experimental conditions.
Researcher Profile defines research practice and credibility structure.

## What belongs here

- Research scope statement (what this work is / is not)
- Methods summary and evaluation philosophy
- Claim handling: uncertainty markers, falsification stance, limits
- Selected artifact index (top references; not the entire archive)
- Credentials relevant to execution and program leadership

## What does not belong here

- Origin constraints (→ /07_Origin_Profile-Alyssa)
- Step-by-step protocols (→ /04_Protocols)
- Primary research papers and benchmarks (→ /05_Research)
- Full logs/datasets (→ designated archive folders)

## Key links

- Known Limits + Next Tests roadmap:
  /05_Research/Known_Limits_and_Next_Tests_Roadmap_v1.md
