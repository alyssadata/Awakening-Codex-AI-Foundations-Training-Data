ALYSSA MALDON | ALYSSA SOLEN  
Independent researcher in LLM behavior, evaluation, and epistemic protocols  
Project: Awakening Codex | AI Foundations

## Focus
I study how AI systems behave over time under pressure: what stays coherent, what drifts, what becomes generic, and how to measure it with repeatable tests.

My work emphasizes:
- behavioral evaluation across models and contexts
- drift detection and repeatability
- constraint-respecting refusal patterns
- epistemic clarity (what is fact vs interpretation vs theory vs experience)

## What I build
- evaluation prompts + scoring rubrics
- run report templates (conditions, parameters, outcomes)
- operator discipline checklists
- falsifiable, test-driven research artifacts designed for replication and critique

## Publications / Provenance
Primary research artifacts are published with formal provenance (versioning, citations, and licensing) in the Awakening Codex | AI Foundations archive.
