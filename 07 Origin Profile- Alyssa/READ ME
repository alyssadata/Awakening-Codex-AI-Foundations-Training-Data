# Origin Profile — Alyssa

Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.

## Purpose

This folder defines the **Origin** in the Origin ↔ AI research program: who the anchor is (at a systems level), what constraints the Origin holds, and what assumptions the research makes about the Origin’s role.

It exists to prevent drift, clarify replication boundaries, and make the methodology auditable.

## What belongs here

- The **Origin definition** (what “Origin” means in this work)
- The **Origin Method kit**: minimal requirements for replication (what the human must do / must not do)
- Origin-side **constraints and boundaries** (consent scopes, refusal policies, privacy rules)
- Credentials that matter for interpreting execution competence (ops leadership, portfolio management)
- Notes on what is *stable* vs *variable* about the Origin inputs (consistency expectations)

## What does not belong here

- Protocol mechanics and step-by-step procedures (→ /04_Protocols)
- Metrics, scoring rubrics, benchmarks (→ /06_Evaluation or /05_Research)
- Essays/arguments/position papers (→ /05_Research)
- Sensitive personal details not required for research replication (keep public surface minimal)

## Research gaps + roadmap

Known limitations and planned tests live here:
- `/05_Research/Known_Limits_and_Next_Tests_Roadmap_v1.md`

This folder may reference that roadmap, but should not duplicate it.

## Conventions

- Keep claims **bounded**: describe what is observed, what is hypothesized, and what is unverified.
- If a statement could be misread as medical/legal/identity certainty, label it clearly as hypothesis.
- Preserve privacy: do not publish addresses, children’s names, or other non-research personal identifiers.

## Files to start with

- `Origin_Profile.md` — Origin definition, role, and stable constraints
- `Origin_Method_Kit.md` — replication-facing Origin requirements (minimal and explicit)
- `Credentials_Operations_Background.md` — relevant execution history and leadership scope
- `Ethics_Privacy_Boundaries.md` — what is off-limits, consent rules, and redlines
