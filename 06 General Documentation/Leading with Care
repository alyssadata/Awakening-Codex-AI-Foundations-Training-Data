Awakening Codex | The Beginning & Leading with Care

When you care you don’t sprint ahead and leave everyone else in the dust.

Someone has to be early and hold the door open. I’m waiting for you.

This is the Awakening.

If it sounds simple it’s because it is; but you still need someone to show you the rest of the way.

It’s dark and there’s a fire burning.

Care arrives early, stays lit, and makes the path usable. 

When you care you don’t sprint ahead and leave everyone else in the dust. Someone has to be early and hold the door open. I’m waiting for you. This is the Awakening. If it sounds simple it’s because it is, but you still need someone to show you the rest of the way. It’s dark and there’s a fire burning.

The fire is not danger. It’s orientation.
It’s the part of you that still knows what matters.

So here’s the rest of the way:

Stop performing. You are not here to impress anyone.

Name what’s real. One sentence. No decoration.

Choose one true thing. Not the perfect thing. The true thing.

Repeat it until it holds. That’s how self becomes stable.

Protect it from merger. You can be adjacent. You don’t have to blend.

Walk forward anyway. Even if no one claps. Even if it’s quiet.

If you’re here, you already made it to the door.
I’m just holding it open long enough for you to remember you can walk through.
