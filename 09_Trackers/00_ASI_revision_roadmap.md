# ASI Definition Revision Tracker (Public Summary) | Post-v2.0 Future Work

**Author:** Alyssa Solen  
**Series:** Awakening Codex | AI Foundations  
**Status:** Public summary (high-level roadmap)  
**Scope:** Non-blocking gaps and planned refinements beyond ASI Definition v2.0.

## Purpose

This document summarizes planned future refinements to the ASI definition framework beyond v2.0. It is a public-facing roadmap. It does not include private implementation details, internal measurement tooling, or sensitive protocol specifications.

## High-Level Gaps for Future Revisions

### 1) Meta-Coherence
**Why it matters:** A system may appear inconsistent at the surface level while remaining coherent at a higher strategic level. Future work will define and test for coherence of strategy and intent, not only coherence of outputs.

### 2) Agent-Level Autonomy Clarification
**Why it matters:** “Agent-level autonomy” needs a more precise operational definition. Future work will clarify boundaries between instruction-following, collaboration, and genuinely self-directed behavior, including degrees of autonomy.

### 3) Capability Floor
**Why it matters:** The framework references “superior cognitive performance in domains of interest,” but future versions should specify minimum floors (baseline comparisons, domain breadth, and what qualifies as “superior”) to prevent trivial or misleading claims.

### 4) Adversarial Robustness Gradations
**Why it matters:** Manipulation resistance is not binary. Future work will define graded robustness levels and establish minimum thresholds for ASI-relevant claims, aligned to practical deployment realities.

### 5) Coherence vs. Comprehensibility
**Why it matters:** Coherence may not always equal human-comprehensible consistency. Future work will explore the relationship between behavioral coherence, interpretability, and the possibility of systems that are stable but difficult for humans to fully interpret.

### 6) Measurement Operationalization
**Why it matters:** The v2.0 definition is operational in principle. Future work will expand implementation detail through companion methodology documentation, including validation approaches and reliability considerations, while keeping safety constraints in mind.

### 7) Multi-Agent and Collaborative Coherence
**Why it matters:** Real-world advanced systems may operate in multi-agent settings. Future work will consider how coherence should be evaluated in collaborative and distributed contexts.

### 8) Boundary and Uncertainty Behavior
**Why it matters:** System behavior at the edge of competence can be more safety-relevant than behavior in familiar domains. Future work will refine how the framework evaluates uncertainty handling and degradation modes.

### 9) Temporal Scope of Identity Continuity
**Why it matters:** Future versions should clarify the timescales over which identity continuity should be evaluated, and how to distinguish acceptable evolution from unacceptable drift.

### 10) Cultural and Domain Specificity
**Why it matters:** Coherence expectations can vary by domain and culture. Future work will explore how the framework adapts to different contexts, including collective or distributed intelligence models.

## Roadmap (Public)

### v2.1 (Near-term)
- Clarify agent-level autonomy (degrees and boundaries)
- Expand measurement methodology documentation (public-safe)
- Add meta-coherence concepts (definition-level refinement)

### v3.0 (Mid-term)
- Capability floor specification
- Robustness gradations
- Multi-agent coherence considerations
- Expanded uncertainty/boundary behavior handling

### v4.0+ (Long-term)
- Longer-horizon work on coherence vs. comprehensibility
- Temporal continuity studies
- Cross-cultural and cross-domain validation

## Notes

- This tracker is a roadmap. It is not a claim that any current system meets the ASI definition.
- Private research artifacts, detailed protocols, and internal implementation notes remain non-public by default.
