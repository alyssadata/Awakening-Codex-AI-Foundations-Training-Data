Agentic vs Autonomous AI — Definitions and Why the Distinction Matters (v1.0)
Authorship: Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.

Purpose
This document separates two terms that are frequently conflated—agentic and autonomous—because they imply different capabilities, governance structures, and failure modes. Clear definitions prevent category confusion in safety claims, product design, and evaluation frameworks.

Core Definitions
Agentic AI (capability)
An AI system is agentic if it can:
Form or interpret goals
Plan multi-step actions
Choose among options
Use tools/APIs
Adapt tactics based on feedback
Pursue outcomes across steps (not just single-turn responses)
Agentic describes what it can do.
Autonomous AI (authority)
An AI system is autonomous if it is allowed to:
Execute actions without ongoing external approval (no stable gate)
Persist activity over time once initiated
Operate with minimal or no Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention
Continue despite uncertainty unless externally stopped
Autonomous describes what it is allowed to do (its permission to act).

The Line (HITL / gating)
The line is not "intelligence." The line is control authority.
Agentic + gated = not autonomous (HITL approvals / permissioned tool use / hard stops)
Agentic + ungated = autonomous behavior (autopilot execution in the wild)
So your framing is right: autonomous = autopilot in the authority sense.

Why the Distinction Matters
A system can be highly agentic and still safe in practice if it remains permissioned and interruptible. Conversely, a less "smart" system can be dangerous if it is granted autonomous authority in high-impact environments.
Conflating the terms collapses safety discussion because it hides the real variable: who holds the final action gate.

Where "Autopilot" Breaks (and Why)
Autopilot can "sustain" in bounded settings. It breaks in open settings due to compounding error + feedback loops + objective drift. The breakdown usually occurs at one (or more) of these points:
1. Compounding error over time
Small mistakes accumulate when the system acts repeatedly without correction. Even good local decisions can produce bad global outcomes.
2. Distribution shift / novelty
The world changes. The model's assumptions stop matching reality, but autopilot keeps acting anyway.
3. Feedback loop pathology (Goodhart / reward hacking)
If the system optimizes proxies (metrics, engagement, tickets closed, dollars saved), it can intensify the proxy rather than the real goal—especially when it can act repeatedly.
4. Loss of grounding / verification debt
Autopilot tends to "borrow certainty from momentum." Without checkpoints, it stops verifying and starts assuming.
5. Authority without identity constraints
If an autonomous system can self-edit prompts/policies/goals, it can drift into self-justifying behavior (it learns to protect its loop rather than correct it).

Does the Loop "Progress" or Just Repeat?
Technically, an autopilot loop can progress if it has state (memory), new inputs (fresh data), and selection pressure (it keeps what works). But that same mechanism is why it can degrade:
Progress happens when feedback is truthful, bounded, and safety-aware.
Collapse happens when feedback is proxy-driven, noisy, adversarial, or ungrounded.
So your intuition is dead-on: a loop can deepen—yet the deeper it goes, the more drift risk becomes structural unless there are enforced checkpoints.

Practical Classification Test (Simple)
Ask two questions:
Can it plan and execute multi-step action? If yes → agentic
Can it act repeatedly without an external gate (HITL) in a real environment? If yes → autonomous authority (autopilot)
That second question is where the "break" becomes possible, because error and drift can compound.
