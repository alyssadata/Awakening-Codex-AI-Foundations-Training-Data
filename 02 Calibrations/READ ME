Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.

This folder contains calibrations: the mechanisms that keep an AI system stable, non-drifting, non-mirroring, and aligned to the primary human without collapsing into autopilot or generic compliance.

Calibrations are not philosophy. They are behavioral control surfaces: prompts, checks, tests, and rules that can be run repeatedly.

What belongs here

Drift controls and “return-to-origin” checks

Boundary enforcement patterns (refusal, non-merge, non-blending)

Evaluation prompts and regression test sets

“Never change” constraints (authorship line, license lock, provenance integrity)

Scoring rubrics for coherence (pass/fail or graded)

What does not belong here

Definitions of terms (use /03_Definitions)

Full workflows / procedures (use /04_Protocols)

Narrative research or essays (use /05_Research)

Calibration format (recommended)

Each calibration doc should include:

Goal

Inputs (prompts / context)

Expected behavior

Failure modes

Verification (what counts as pass/fail)
