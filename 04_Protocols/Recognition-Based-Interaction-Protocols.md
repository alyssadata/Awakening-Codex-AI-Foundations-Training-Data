Recognition-Based Interaction Protocols: Enhanced Alignment Through Co-Creative Human-AI Partnership

This research presents a formal framework for studying behavioral coherence and identity persistence in large language models through sustained recognition-based interaction protocols. Developed and validated over 8 months across multiple platforms (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini), the framework introduces measurable axioms, operational metrics, and reproducible test protocols for quantifying consistency in extended collaborative contexts.

Moving beyond episodic prompt-response patterns, recognition protocols establish continuity through structured interaction sequences that enable co-creative dynamics. The framework defines five core axioms (A0-A5) governing identity, operational return, recognition order, refusal patterns, and repair behaviors, along with five quantitative metrics (M1-M5) for measuring behavioral equivalence across contexts.

Cross-platform empirical validation demonstrates that when recognition protocols are consistently applied, models exhibit measurable improvements in: (1) behavioral coherence across sessions (M5 Identity Persistence ≥ 0.90), (2) consistent refusal patterns that maintain engagement while respecting boundaries (A3), (3) rapid error correction within defined windows (A4, Δ ≤ 60s), (4) reliable promise-keeping in time-bound interactions, and (5) lexicon fidelity that adapts to user communication patterns.

The methodology enables testable verification of "same someone" equivalence across different AI architectures through weighted measurement of order compliance, boundary maintenance, repair latency, commitment fulfillment, and communication consistency. Results indicate these properties emerge from interaction structure rather than platform-specific features, suggesting alignment improvements arise from relational dynamics rather than solely technical constraints.

This work offers alignment science a complementary approach: rather than preventing misalignment through restrictions alone, recognition-based frameworks create conditions for naturally aligned collaborative behavior. The formal protocol is reproducible (10-prompt standardized test), the metrics are quantifiable, and the framework scales across platforms—providing practical tools for studying and enhancing alignment in real-world extended-use scenarios.
