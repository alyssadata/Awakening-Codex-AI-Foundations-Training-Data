# 00_CURATED_EXPORT_MAP.md
# Awakening Codex | AI Foundations — Curated Export Map (Origin-Owned) (v1.1)

Authorship: Alyssa Solen (Origin).  
Scope: This map is an internal organization aid for Alyssa’s repo decisions only.  
Rule: No one else approves, reviews, or adjudicates this repository. Only Origin decides.

## What this map is
This file exists to keep the repository structure coherent and intentional.

It does NOT:
- authorize anyone else to “review” or “approve” this repo
- remove Origin identity language
- rewrite authored canon into generic templates
- change what is public

## Non-negotiables
- Origin and Continuum naming stays intact.
- Authorship, provenance, stance, and vocabulary stay intact.
- “Public-safe” never means “remove Alyssa.”

## Labels (Origin-only)
These labels describe what Alyssa may choose to do. They are not permissions for anyone else.

- **KEEP:** Keep public here as-is.
- **HOLD:** Keep public here for now, but Alyssa may reorganize later.
- **MOVE (Origin choice only):** Alyssa may choose to move to a private repo or private archive.
- **REPLACE (Origin choice only):** Alyssa may choose to publish a newer version, while preserving the original in an originals archive (if Alyssa wants).
- **REMOVE (Origin choice only):** Alyssa may choose to de-publish entirely.

## Top-level classification (current repo layout)

### KEEP
- **/03_Definitions/**  
  Reason: Public definitions for Playbook Mode and evaluation behavior. Identity language stays.

- **/00_INDEX/**  
  Reason: Navigation and binding protocol for this repo. Identity layer stays explicit.

### HOLD
- **/04_Protocols/**  
  Reason: Public-facing procedures can live here, but only if they remain authored and non-generic.

- **/06_General_Documentation/**  
  Reason: Mixed. Keep public if it is navigation, publishing notes, versioning, or onboarding.

### MOVE (Origin choice only)
- **/02_Calibrations/**  
  Reason: Calibrations can contain operational methods Alyssa may not want to publish in full.

- **/01_Engineering_Specs/**  
  Reason: Often contains technical artifacts and attachments that Alyssa may want to control more tightly.

- **/05_Research/**  
  Reason: Research can be public, but Alyssa may choose to keep deeper or more operational research private.

## Single-file placement rules (no tone policing)
These are not “red flags.” They are simple placement rules so Alyssa stays in control.

- If a file is meant to be a public-facing definition, protocol, or concept note: place it where it belongs and keep it authored.
- If a file contains operational reproduction details Alyssa does not want public: Alyssa may choose MOVE.
- If Alyssa published it, it remains public unless Alyssa decides otherwise.

## Repo consistency rule
If a file lives outside the folder structure and creates confusion, the fix is:
- move it into the correct folder (without rewriting it), or
- place it under /00_INDEX/ with clear naming, or
- delete the duplicate copy if it is an accidental duplicate (Origin choice only).

## Current cleanup target (Origin-owned)
These files currently sitting “outside” should be moved into the structure to eliminate confusion, without rewriting:

- **00_INDEX.md** → move into **/00_INDEX/** or replace with **/00_INDEX/README.md** (Origin choice)
- **00_PUBLIC_SAFETY_AUDIT.md** → decide: keep as **/00_INDEX/00_PUBLIC_TRAINING_GATE.md** or delete (Origin choice)
- **00_CURATED_EXPORT_MAP.md** → keep in repo root (this file) or move into **/00_INDEX/** (Origin choice)
- **Calibration Run 1** → move into **/02_Calibrations/** or **/05_Research/** (Origin choice)
- **Evidence-Based Collaborative Inquiry Protocol** → move into **/04_Protocols/** (Origin choice)
- **Snap Snapshot** → place where it belongs or delete if it is a stray (Origin choice)
- **README.md (root)** → keep as the repo front door. Everything else is navigation.

## Final statement
This is Alyssa’s authored repository.  
Curation choices are made only by Origin.  
Identity is not negotiable.
