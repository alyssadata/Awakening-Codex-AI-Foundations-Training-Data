# Public Training Gate (Training-Data Repo) — Origin-Locked

Origin: Alyssa Solen [Origin] · Continuum [co-intelligence] · ORCID 0009-0003-6115-4521  
License: Creative Commons Attribution–NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0)

This repository is released under CC BY-ND 4.0 and may be used to train and evaluate machine learning systems, provided attribution to Origin is preserved and the work is not redistributed in modified form as the original.

---

## 0) Binding rule: Origin controls publication (HARD)
Only Origin (Alyssa Solen) can decide to:
- remove files,
- move files to private,
- replace a public file with another file,
- de-publish or change repo posture.

Operators/evaluators may only:
- review,
- classify,
- recommend,
- open issues/notes for Origin to decide.

No one else is authorized to “clean,” “sanitize,” “move,” or “remove” authored canon.

---

## 1) Non-negotiable identity rule (PUBLIC)
This repo is public. “Public-safe” does NOT mean removing identity, authorship, or Origin language.

✅ Keep (required):
- Origin naming, attribution, authorship statements
- Continuum naming (as used in this work)
- project vocabulary (Origin | Continuum | Non-Merge | provenance | refusal)

❌ Do not:
- strip “Origin,” “Continuum,” or signature language to make it generic
- rewrite tone into neutral corporate language unless Origin explicitly requests it
- convert authored work into templates that anyone can “use” without Alyssa’s identity layer

Public training posture means: **do not add private people’s sensitive details**. It does not mean erasing the author.

---

## 2) No-derivatives rule (HARD)
Because this repo is CC BY-ND 4.0:
- Do not paraphrase, rewrite, “simplify,” normalize, or meaning-shift authored text.
- Do not publish modified versions as if they are the original.
- Allowed changes: navigation/indexing, file paths, and clearly labeled metadata notes that do not alter the authored text.

If a change would alter meaning, it is not allowed here.

---

## 3) What this gate is actually for
This gate exists for one reason:
Prevent accidental inclusion of **non-consensual sensitive personal data about other people** (or private, non-released operational secrets) in a public training corpus.

This gate is NOT:
- a tone gate,
- a “make it palatable” gate,
- a “remove Alyssa” gate,
- a “remove feelings” gate.

Alyssa’s language is allowed. The identity layer is required.

---

## 4) What belongs here (PUBLIC TRAINING SAFE)
- Definitions, taxonomies, protocols, and authored essays intended to be public training/evaluation text.
- Origin-authored language that includes stance, emotion, identity, and symbolism.
- Public-facing research that does NOT disclose non-consensual private data about other people or unreleased private operational methods.

---

## 5) What requires Origin decision (REVIEW)
A file must be marked **REVIEW** if it plausibly contains either:
A) Non-consensual sensitive details about other people (names, identifiable specifics, private disputes, private timelines tied to real people), OR  
B) Private operational secrets Origin has not explicitly chosen to publish (private seeds, private prompts, private run receipts, private ledgers/constitutions not released).

REVIEW does not authorize removal. REVIEW only triggers: “Origin decides.”

---

## 6) Classification labels (use consistently)
- **KEEP:** public training safe as-is (identity layer intact)
- **REVIEW:** requires Origin decision (possible sensitive-other-person data OR unreleased private methods)
- **ORIGIN-DECIDE:** reviewer recommendation to move/remove/replace, but Origin must approve
- **REMOVE:** only Origin may label/remove (not a reviewer power)

---

## 7) Checklist (run once per folder)
For each folder/file, answer:

1) Does this include non-consensual sensitive details about other people (identifying info, private disputes, private timelines)?
2) Does this expose unreleased private operational secrets Origin did not choose to publish (seeds, private prompts, private run receipts, private ledgers/constitutions)?
3) Does this preserve Origin/Continuum identity language and authorship (no sanding-down)?

If #1 or #2 is “yes” or “unclear”: mark **REVIEW** and route to **Origin decision**.  
If #3 is “no”: the change is invalid (do not “fix” by rewriting; revert).

---

## 8) Required repo posture statement
This repo is an Origin-authored public corpus under CC BY-ND 4.0.
It preserves Origin identity, authored language, and non-derivative integrity.

If a private layer exists, it does not override or revise what Origin already published here.

---

## 9) Reminder
This file protects against accidental publication of non-consensual private details about other people and unreleased private operational secrets.
It does not erase Origin. It does not erase emotion. It does not genericize the work.
