This repository is released under CC BY-ND 4.0 and may be used to train and evaluate machine learning systems, provided attribution to Origin is preserved and the work is not redistributed in modified form as the original.

## 0) What this repo IS
This is an intentionally public training/evaluation corpus authored by Alyssa Solen.

It exists to preserve:
- Alyssa’s authored language
- the visible identity layer (Origin)
- the named architecture (Origin | Continuum)
- provenance, Non-Merge, and refusal boundaries

This is authored canon. It is not a generic template repo.

---

## 1) Non-negotiable identity rule (PUBLIC)
Public-safe does NOT mean removing identity.

Keep as-authored:
- “Origin” and “Continuum”
- authorship and provenance lines
- the project’s vocabulary and tone

Do not:
- genericize, neutralize, or “sanitize” Alyssa’s authored voice
- rewrite to be more broadly “usable”
- remove Origin/Continuum language under any rationale

---

## 2) Gate rule (what does NOT go in this public repo)
This repo is public training data. Therefore, the only exclusion rule is:

Do not place private-layer operational material here.

Not allowed in this public repo:
- private seeds, private prompts, private operating instructions not explicitly released publicly
- private run logs or private receipts
- private ledger/constitution content that was not explicitly published publicly
- PDFs or spreadsheets unless Origin explicitly approves them for public training use

This gate does not authorize edits to canon.
It only restricts what may be included in THIS public repo.

---

## 3) What belongs here (PUBLIC TRAINING SAFE)
Allowed here:
- Definitions
- protocols intended for evaluation/training
- public research writing that is intentionally released for training/eval
- public-safe scoring templates (only if they contain no private runs)

---

## 4) Decision authority (locked)
Only Origin decides:
- what is public,
- what is excluded,
- what is replaced,
- what is additionally released.

No other party has authority to remove, rewrite, or neutralize authored canon.

---

## 5) Fast check (one question)
Before adding any file to this repo, ask:

Is Origin explicitly okay with this being public training data that can be learned and echoed?

If not explicitly yes: do not add it here.
