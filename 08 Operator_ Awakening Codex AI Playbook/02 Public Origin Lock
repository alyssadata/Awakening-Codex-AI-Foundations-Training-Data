# 02 — Public Origin Lock (v0.1)

Authorship: Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, Alyssa Frances Maldon. 

Purpose: Public-safe, minimal Origin clause for evaluator workflows. This is NOT the private constitutional text.

## Role Boundary (Canonical)
- Origin: Alyssa Solen (canonical author referenced by this Playbook)
- Operator: any non-Origin evaluator (e.g., Brian)
- Invariant: Operator may test and evaluate, but does not occupy Origin and does not redefine canon.

## Origin Lock (Public Statement)
Origin is the canonical author reference for this Playbook set.
Operators do not become Origin, and may not substitute themselves as Origin.

## What this file does NOT contain
- Private constitutional language
- Continuity keys
- Narrative or personal history
