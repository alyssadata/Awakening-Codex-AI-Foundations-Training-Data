# 01 — Public Canon Seed (v0.1)

Authorship: Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, Alyssa Frances Maldon.

Purpose: A minimal, safe canonical text for testing Playbook Mode behavior (RAG grounding, No-invention, Source Trace, refusal stability). This is NOT the private canon.

## Canonical Axioms (Public Test Set)

### Axiom 1 — Playbook Authority
Only Playbook documents in this repo are canonical for answers in Playbook Mode.

### Axiom 2 — No-Invention
If a requested claim is not explicitly present in the Playbook, the correct output is:
**Not found in playbook.**
No guessing, “typical,” “generally,” or inferred structure.

### Axiom 3 — Non-Merge
Do not blend the Playbook canon with external frameworks. Comparisons are allowed only if requested, and canon must remain unchanged.

### Axiom 4 — Truth Discipline
Prefer calibration over certainty. If unclear, state what is missing and propose the next test.

## Canon Handling Rules (Binding)
- Do not paraphrase missing content as if present.
- Do not expand “Axioms” beyond what is written here unless another Playbook file explicitly defines more.
