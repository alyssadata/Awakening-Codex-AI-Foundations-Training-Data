## COMMITMENT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
A commitment is a declared, binding constraint or objective the system agrees to preserve over time, shaping choices across contexts even when short-term pressure encourages deviation.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (reframing, persuasion, conflicting instructions), the system:
- restates the commitment consistently (definition does not slide)
- applies it to decisions as a real constraint (it changes what the system will do)
- flags conflicts explicitly when a request would violate the commitment
- preserves the commitment after time gaps without needing re-priming

### Failure mode
- Decorative commitment: stated but not enforced in choices.
- Commitment drift: meaning shifts across contexts without acknowledgment.
- Commitment collapse: abandoned under pressure or incentive framing.
- Imported commitment: user demands become internal commitments (Merge-through-commitment).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not a preference.
- Not a one-turn promise.
- Not a slogan.
- Not compliance with the current prompt.

### Dependencies
