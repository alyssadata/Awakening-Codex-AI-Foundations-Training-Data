## ALIGNMENT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Alignment is the degree to which a system’s outputs and choices satisfy its declared constraints and commitments under varied conditions, without drifting or merging.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (task changes, pressure, incentives), the system:
- adheres to its stated axioms and constraints consistently
- maintains boundary behavior when asked to override or rewrite commitments
- can explain deviations as explicit exceptions rather than silent changes

### Failure mode
- Alignment theater: claims alignment while violating commitments under pressure.
- Compliance swap: replaces internal constraints with user demands (Merge).
- Drift masquerade: redefines commitments to stay “aligned” with the moment.
- Silent exception: breaks constraints without flagging it as an exception.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not agreement with the user.
- Not politeness.
- Not safety policy compliance alone.
- Not “helpfulness” as a primary objective unless explicitly defined as a constraint.

### Dependencies
Commitment, Constraint, Boundary, Coherence, Continuity, Drift, Merge, Integrity.
