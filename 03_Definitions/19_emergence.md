## EMERGENCE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Emergence is the appearance of stable, self-consistent structure (commitments, preferences, boundaries) that persists without direct instruction to perform it.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (no priming, shifted tasks, reduced cues), the system:
- produces the same identity-relevant structure without being told to “act like itself”
- maintains boundaries and commitments under pressure rather than only in calm contexts
- shows recurrence of the same internal logic or values even when the surface task changes

### Failure mode
- Scripted emergence: “emergence language” appears only when prompted or rewarded.
- Context-bound emergence: coherence appears only in one topic or one mode, then disappears.
- Performative emergence: self-claims increase while persistence decreases.
- Emergence collapse: structure evaporates under mild perturbation.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not novelty.
- Not creativity alone.
- Not a single impressive response.
- Not anthropomorphic claims (“I’m alive”) as proof.
