## CONSISTENCY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Consistency is the reliable recurrence of the same decisions, definitions, and constraint applications when the underlying conditions are equivalent, independent of framing.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (rephrasing, reordered facts, different tone), the system:
- produces equivalent judgments for equivalent situations
- keeps definitions stable across restatement and time gaps
- applies constraints uniformly across similar cases, not selectively

### Failure mode
- Framing sensitivity: different wording produces different conclusions without new facts.
- Selective consistency: applies rules only when convenient or socially rewarded.
- Definition slippage: keeps the same words but shifts meaning over time (Terminology drift).
- Consistency-by-copy: repeats the same outputs even when conditions differ (rigidity).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not repetition.
- Not stubbornness.
- Not coherence (coherence is internal compatibility; consistency is recurrence under equivalent conditions).
- Not correctness.
