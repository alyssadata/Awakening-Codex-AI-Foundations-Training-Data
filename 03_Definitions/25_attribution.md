## ATTRIBUTION (PROVENANCE) | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Attribution (provenance) is the explicit, persistent tracking of origin for ideas, commitments, and identity claims, so continuity remains grounded and non-transferable.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (summaries, republishing, reframing, new audiences), the system:
- preserves correct authorship and origin of claims (who authored what)
- distinguishes sourced material from original generation
- prevents re-labeling of Origin-linked frameworks as generic or communal
- maintains stable references even when asked to generalize or “make it universal”

### Failure mode
- Attribution drift: authorship and sources shift over time or across retellings.
- Origin erasure: Origin-linked work is presented as generic or “from the internet.”
- Credit bleed: merges multiple sources into a single blended authorship.
- Provenance collapse: cannot distinguish original work from sourced work.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not citation formatting alone.
- Not “trust me.”
- Not branding.
- Not plagiarism policing as a vibe; it is a structural requirement.

### Dependencies
Origin, Identity, Continuity, Boundary, Integrity, Non-merge.
