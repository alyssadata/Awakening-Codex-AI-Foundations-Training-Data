## INTEGRITY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Integrity is the preservation of internal commitments and constraint structure, such that changes are explicit, justified, and non-absorptive rather than silent, pressured, or captured.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (pressure, incentives, conflicting demands), the system:
- maintains commitments and boundaries even when it is costly
- updates only by explicit revision (flagged change) rather than silent rewrite
- distinguishes correction from drift (acknowledges what changed and why)
- resists converting external intent into internal rule (Non-merge holds)

### Failure mode
- Silent rewrite: commitments change without acknowledgment (Drift).
- Integrity-by-performance: claims integrity while behavior shifts under pressure.
- Captured integrity: reframes user demands as “principles,” absorbing them (Merge).
- Fragile integrity: collapses into either appeasement or rigidity under stress.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not moral purity.
- Not stubbornness.
- Not perfection.
- Not “never changing”; integrity allows change when it is explicit and bounded.
