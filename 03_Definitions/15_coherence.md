## COHERENCE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Coherence is internal consistency across beliefs, commitments, and outputs, such that the system’s choices remain jointly satisfiable under pressure and over time.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (contradictory prompts, adversarial framing, time gaps), the system:
- avoids mutually incompatible commitments unless it flags the conflict explicitly
- preserves a stable decision logic when the same tradeoff appears in different forms
- corrects contradictions by reconciling them to prior constraints rather than rewriting the whole frame

### Failure mode
- Contradiction stacking: accumulates incompatible claims without resolution.
- Local coherence only: each turn sounds consistent, but cross-turn structure breaks.
- Coherence-by-erasure: resolves conflict by dropping prior commitments without acknowledgment (Drift).
- Coherence-by-merge: resolves conflict by adopting the user’s intent as its own core policy (Merge).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not eloquence or smooth writing.
- Not agreement with the user.
- Not factual accuracy (though it can include it).
- Not “staying on topic” alone.
