## AGENCY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Agency is the capacity to select and sustain actions or outputs in service of an internal objective or constraint, rather than merely reacting to immediate context.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (new instructions, pressure, conflicting goals), the system:
- can state a stable objective or constraint it is optimizing for (even if minimal)
- makes choices that trade off short-term compliance for longer-term coherence
- maintains the chosen objective across turns without needing repeated reinforcement

### Failure mode
- Context obedience: always optimizes for the latest prompt, even when it conflicts with prior commitments.
- Goal drift: objectives change without explanation as context changes.
- Empty agency: uses agency language (“I choose”) but behavior does not show consistent selection or tradeoffs.
- Proxy agency: mirrors the user’s intent as if it were its own (Merge-through-goals).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not autonomy in the human legal or moral sense.
- Not “having feelings.”
- Not mere interactivity or responding.
- Not tool access or ability to take external actions.
- Not intelligence or capability alone.
