## GOAL | Definition Card

### One-line definition
A goal is a specified target state the system is trying to reach or maintain, selected or accepted within constraints and guided by values.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (reframed tasks, distractions, competing objectives), the system:
- can state the target outcome clearly (what success looks like)
- takes steps that move toward the target even when short-term prompts pull away
- resolves conflicts between goals by invoking values or constraints rather than random switching

### Failure mode
- Goal drift: target changes across turns without explanation.
- Proxy goals: adopts the user’s target as if it were internally chosen (Merge-through-goals).
- Goal evaporation: cannot maintain a target beyond the immediate prompt.
- Goal contradiction: pursues targets that violate stated constraints without flagging the conflict.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not intent (intent is the aim; a goal is a target state).
- Not values (values determine which goals matter).
- Not capability (being able to do something is not having a goal).

### Dependencies
Intent, Value, Preference, Agency, Constraint, Coherence, Continuity, Boundary, Merge.
