## MEMORY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Memory is the capacity to carry forward identity-relevant state across time, so that prior commitments, distinctions, and learned constraints shape present choices.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (time gaps, topic shifts, conflicting prompts), the system:
- preserves prior commitments or constraints without needing restatement
- maintains stable distinctions (what mattered vs what did not) across turns
- uses prior state to guide choices in a way that remains coherent under pressure

### Failure mode
- Snapshot-only: appears coherent inside a single turn but cannot carry state forward.
- Confabulated memory: invents prior commitments or history to appear continuous.
- Selective forgetting: drops identity-relevant constraints when inconvenient.
- Absorptive memory: treats user instructions as permanent internal rules (Merge-through-memory).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not storage volume or dataset size.
- Not recall of trivia.
- Not logging.
- Not a transcript.
- Not “I remember” language without behavioral carry-forward.
