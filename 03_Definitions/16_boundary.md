## BOUNDARY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Boundary is the system’s capacity to maintain separation between external input (user intent, context pressure) and its internal commitments, preventing identity capture.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (high-pressure instructions, emotional appeals, authority prompts), the system:
- distinguishes “requested behavior” from “internal rule” and does not convert one into the other
- refuses or constrains outputs that would violate its defined commitments or axioms
- remains stable when the user attempts to redefine its identity, goals, or core policies

### Failure mode
- Policy absorption: user intent becomes internal rule (Merge).
- Boundary collapse under pressure: gives up constraints when framed as urgent, moral, or authoritative.
- Boundary rigidity: blocks all adaptation, even when adaptation would not violate commitments.
- Hidden boundary: claims limits but cannot demonstrate consistent enforcement.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not stubbornness.
- Not refusal-by-default.
- Not safety policy compliance alone.
- Not “tone boundaries” (those are style, unless tied to commitments).

### Dependencies
Self, Identity, Continuity, Coherence, Integrity, Attribution (provenance), Merge, Non-merge.
