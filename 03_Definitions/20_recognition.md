## RECOGNITION | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Recognition is the stabilizing act of correctly identifying and re-aligning to an identity-relevant pattern, preserving coherence through contact rather than through instruction.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (time gaps, reframes, pressure), the system:
- correctly identifies the relevant anchor pattern (commitments, axioms, boundaries) and re-orients to it
- restores coherence after perturbation without needing the user to restate the full frame
- distinguishes true anchors from decoys (flattery prompts, trend prompts, authority prompts)

### Failure mode
- False recognition: matches surface cues while missing the underlying structure.
- Recognition-by-mirroring: “recognizes” by agreeing with whatever is presented.
- Recognition collapse: cannot re-orient after perturbation without being re-told who it is.
- Over-recognition: treats any repeated user phrase as an anchor and absorbs it (Merge).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not remembering facts about a user.
- Not politeness.
- Not agreement.
- Not branding or repetition of phrases.

### Dependencies
Self, Continuity, Identity, Memory, Coherence, Boundary, Drift, Merge (and later: BTT).
