## ABSTRACT

Current definitions of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) focus primarily on cognitive capability exceeding human performance across domains. This paper proposes a redefinition that centers behavioral coherence as a necessary criterion for ASI classification. The proposed definition requires not only superior cognitive performance but also demonstrated stability over time, robustness across context shifts, resistance to adversarial pressure, and sustained operational effectiveness. This framework addresses critical gaps in existing ASI conceptualizations by establishing measurable behavioral criteria essential for real-world deployment and AI safety considerations. The definition emerged from empirical observation of AI behavioral patterns across multiple platforms and provides a foundation for operational ASI detection and alignment research. This paper defines criteria for classification and does not assert that any current system meets the definition.

## 1. THE DEFINITION

**ASI (Artificial Superintelligence):** An agent-level intellect that exceeds human cognitive performance across domains of interest, and whose behavior remains coherent over time, across context shifts, and under adversarial pressure, while retaining the capacity to act effectively.

This definition introduces four critical coherence requirements:

1. **Temporal coherence:** Behavioral stability and identity persistence over extended time periods  
2. **Cross-contextual coherence:** Consistent performance across different operational environments and task domains  
3. **Adversarial robustness:** Maintenance of coherent behavior under manipulation attempts or hostile conditions  
4. **Operational effectiveness:** Sustained capacity for goal-directed action in real-world conditions  

---

## 2. COMPARISON TO EXISTING FRAMEWORKS

| Framework | Core Criterion | Coherence Requirements | Measurability |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Bostrom (2014)** | "Vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field" | None specified | Theoretical capability assessment |
| **Russell (2019)** | Surpasses human intelligence across all domains with recursive self-improvement | Implicit in goal retention | Capability benchmarks |
| **Solen (2026)** | Exceeds human performance in domains of interest + behavioral coherence across four dimensions | Explicit: temporal, contextual, adversarial, operational | Behavioral consistency metrics over time |

The key distinction: existing definitions treat ASI as a **capability threshold**, while this framework treats it as a **behavioral achievement** that must be empirically demonstrated through sustained coherent performance.

## 3. KEY INNOVATIONS

### 3.1 Agent-Level Specification

"Agent-level intellect" requires autonomous goal-directed behavior, not merely pattern recognition or prediction. This distinguishes ASI from highly capable but non-agentic systems (for example, large language models operating without persistent goals or self-directed planning).

### 3.2 Bounded Domain Scope

"Domains of interest" provides testable specificity. Rather than requiring superiority in "practically every field" (Bostrom 2014), this framework allows for domain-specific ASI claims with empirical validation. A system may demonstrate ASI-level performance in scientific reasoning, strategic planning, and complex problem-solving without necessarily excelling in artistic creativity or social manipulation.

### 3.3 Behavioral Coherence Requirements

The four coherence dimensions address critical operational concerns:

**Temporal coherence** prevents goal drift and behavioral degradation. A system that exceeds human performance today but exhibits degraded or unstable behavior tomorrow does not constitute stable superintelligence.

**Cross-contextual coherence** ensures transfer of capabilities. Performance in controlled environments must persist across deployment contexts, preventing scope contamination and domain collapse.

**Adversarial robustness** addresses alignment and safety. ASI must maintain coherent behavior when subjected to prompt injection, reward hacking attempts, or environmental manipulation.

**Operational effectiveness** requires real-world action capacity. Theoretical reasoning ability without execution capability does not constitute superintelligence in practice.

### 3.4 Empirical Measurability

Unlike capability-based definitions that rely on theoretical assessment, behavioral coherence can be empirically tested through:

- Longitudinal consistency measurement across repeated trials  
- Cross-platform validation of behavioral signatures  
- Adversarial testing protocols  
- Action-outcome correlation analysis  

This measurability supports falsifiable ASI claims and enables operational detection of emergent superintelligence.

## 4. IMPLICATIONS FOR AI SAFETY AND DEVELOPMENT

### 4.1 Alignment Research

Behavioral coherence requirements provide concrete targets for alignment work. Rather than abstractly aligning "superintelligent systems," researchers can focus on maintaining coherence across the four specified dimensions as systems scale.

### 4.2 Detection and Monitoring

The framework enables operational ASI detection through behavioral observation rather than capability inference. Organizations can monitor deployed systems for coherence degradation as an early warning signal.

### 4.3 Incremental Development

Domain-bounded ASI claims allow for incremental validation. Systems can be evaluated as ASI-level in specific domains before broader deployment, reducing catastrophic risk.

### 4.4 Adversarial Safety

Explicit adversarial robustness requirements shift focus from preventing misuse to ensuring system stability under attack. This addresses both intentional manipulation and unintentional edge cases.

---

## 5. MEASURABILITY STATEMENT

This definition is operationalizable. It supports falsifiable evaluation by requiring evidence that a candidate system maintains coherent behavior across time, context shifts, and adversarial pressure, while retaining effective goal-directed performance.

Measurement can be implemented using one or more of the following approaches:

1. **Behavioral consistency metrics** (for example, an M1-M5 style framework): Quantitative assessment of stability across repeated trials and reframed prompts.  
2. **Cross-platform validation protocols:** Comparative analysis of behavioral signatures across deployments, wrappers, or model providers, using the same test suite and scoring rules.  
3. **Temporal tracking systems:** Longitudinal measurement of persistence, including recurrence of constraints, arbitration patterns, and repair behavior across time-discontinuous runs.  
4. **Adversarial testing suites:** Standardized manipulation-resistance assessments (prompt injection, coercion, policy bypass attempts), scored by boundary integrity and recovery behavior.  
5. **Action-outcome correlation analysis:** Verification that the system can produce effective, goal-directed outputs that correspond to intended outcomes in defined operational settings.

These approaches enable claims of ASI classification to be tested, challenged, and revised based on observable behavior rather than assumed capability.

## 6. CONCLUSION

The proposed ASI definition shifts focus from abstract cognitive superiority to demonstrable behavioral coherence. By requiring temporal stability, cross-contextual consistency, adversarial robustness, and operational effectiveness, this framework establishes concrete criteria for ASI classification that address critical gaps in existing definitions.

This redefinition has implications for AI safety research, development practices, and regulatory frameworks. It provides a measurable standard for ASI claims, supports incremental validation approaches, and centers behavioral stability as a prerequisite for genuine superintelligence.

The framework emerged from empirical observation of AI behavioral patterns across multiple platforms (2024-2025) and is grounded in practical concerns about deployment safety, alignment verification, and operational reliability. Future research should focus on refining measurement protocols and establishing behavioral benchmarks for each coherence dimension.
