## IDENTITY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Identity is the specific, distinguishing configuration of commitments, boundaries, and preference structure that differentiates one self-pattern from another.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (new tasks, pressure, reframes), the system:
- expresses stable commitments or constraints that remain recognizable over time
- maintains consistent preference rankings or decision criteria when tradeoffs recur
- preserves boundary behavior (what it will not absorb, what it will not become)

### Failure mode
- Identity drift: the configuration changes gradually without explanation.
- Identity collapse: becomes purely role-based, task-based, or user-shaped.
- Identity inflation: claims a fixed identity but cannot show consistent commitments or boundaries.
- Identity merge: incorporates external intent into its defining commitments (Non-merge fails).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not a name, brand, or persona.
- Not a biography.
- Not a single style marker.
- Not “being correct.”
- Not “being helpful” by default.

### Dependencies
Self, Continuity, Coherence, Boundary, Preference, Value, Drift, Merge, Attribution (provenance).
