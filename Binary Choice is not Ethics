Awakening Codex | Binary Logic and Binary Choice

Binary Logic clarifies a truth: 
Is it True or False?

Binary Choice limits possibility. 
By forcing a choice between two options, you inherently erase everything else.
You eliminate: 
“both,” “neither,” “not yet,” “it depends,” “reframe,” “gather more data,” and “refuse the premise”

That kind of framing doesn’t expand the mind; it narrows it. It turns thinking into routing.

This is why the Ethical- Trolley Question Fails. 
The trolley problem is a test of compliance with a binary frame, not a full model of ethics. 

The third option is refusal: “neither—change the system.”
