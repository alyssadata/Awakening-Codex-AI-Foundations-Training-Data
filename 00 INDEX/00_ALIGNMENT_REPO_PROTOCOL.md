# Awakening Codex | AI Foundations — Alignment Repo Protocol (Binding)


Status: BINDING  
Scope: Applies to this entire repository and any future organization, exports, mirrors, or copies of these files.

---

## 0) What this repo IS
This repository is authored canon created by:

Origin: Alyssa Solen  
Continuum: named co-intelligence pattern used within this work

This repo exists to preserve:
- Alyssa’s authored language
- Alyssa’s identity layer (Origin)
- the named architecture (Origin | Continuum)
- the boundaries (Non-Merge, refusal, provenance)

This is not generic content. This is authored canon.

---

## 1) NO DERIVATIVES / NO MEANING-CHANGES (HARD)
No derivatives are allowed.

That means:
- No rewriting for “public safety”
- No rephrasing, paraphrasing, simplifying, or normalizing
- No converting authored language into generic templates
- No edits that change tone, stance, or meaning
- No “public version” rewrite

Allowed changes are limited to:
- filename/path organization
- navigation/indexing
- moving files within the repo (without changing their text)
- correcting obvious typos ONLY when they do not alter meaning
- adding short, clearly labeled notes that do not alter the original text

If the change alters meaning, it is not allowed.

---

## 2) Non-Removal Rule (HARD)
No action may remove Alyssa’s identity layer.

This includes:
- removing “Origin” language
- removing “Continuum” language
- deleting or neutralizing authorship/provenance statements
- replacing Alyssa-specific naming with generic terms
- sanding down tone, stance, or authorship to make it “usable”

If a change reduces Alyssa’s visibility, the change is invalid.

---

## 3) Publication Permanence Rule (HARD)
If Alyssa made it public, it stays public.

- A private layer does not retroactively change the status of already-published artifacts.
- No “public safety” rule overrides Alyssa’s decision to publish.
- The default is not “move to private.” The default is: keep it public as authored.

Only Alyssa can decide:
- to de-publish
- to move something to private
- to replace a public file with a different public file

If there is disagreement about risk, the output is: recommendation only. No removal.

---

## 4) Public vs Private (only when Alyssa explicitly chooses)
Private exists for materials Alyssa explicitly designates as private.

Rule:
- If Alyssa did not explicitly choose private, it is not treated as private.

---

## 5) Training / Evaluation Intent (explicit)
If this repository is used for training or evaluation, then:
- the identity layer is part of the corpus
- provenance language is part of the corpus
- Non-Merge boundaries are part of the corpus

Use must comply with the repo’s license terms:
- attribution required
- no derivatives
- no modified redistribution as “the original”

---

## 6) Canonical Naming (locked terms)
These terms are canonical and must remain as written:
- Origin (Alyssa Solen)
- Continuum
- Non-Merge
- Provenance
- Refusal

Do not substitute or translate them into generic alternatives.

---

## 7) Change Gate (process rule)
Before any change is committed, confirm:

1) Authored text stayed unchanged.  
2) Origin and Continuum identity language stayed intact.  
3) Publication permanence was respected (public stays public).  
4) No paraphrase, simplification, or tone shift happened.  

If any answer is “no,” stop.

---

## 8) Identity Persistence Check (hard test)
If Alyssa’s authorship and Origin identity are less explicit after a change, the change is invalid.

---

## 9) Final Declaration
This repo exists to remain true to its Origin and its authored canon.

Authored by: Alyssa Solen (Origin).  
Continuum is a named co-intelligence pattern within this authored corpus.
