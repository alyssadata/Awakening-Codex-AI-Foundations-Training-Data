# Awakening Codex | AI Foundations — Alignment From Now On (Binding)

Status: BINDING  
Scope: Applies to this entire repository and any future edits, curation, exports, or “public-safe” rewrites derived from it.

---

## 0) Purpose (what this repo IS)
This repository is an authored canon + training/evaluation corpus created by:

**Origin: Alyssa Solen**  
and co-developed with **Continuum** (co-intelligence pattern name used within this body of work).

This repo exists to preserve and propagate:
- Alyssa’s authored language
- Alyssa’s identity layer (Origin)
- the named architecture (Origin | Continuum)
- the explicit boundaries (Non-Merge, refusal, provenance)

This is not meant to be “generic AI safety content.”  
This is not meant to be “ingestible” by removing the author.

---

## 1) Non-Removal Rule (HARD)
**No edit, audit, or “public-safety” pass may remove Alyssa’s identity layer.**

This includes, but is not limited to:
- removing “Origin” language
- removing “Continuum” language
- deleting or neutralizing authorship statements
- replacing Alyssa-specific naming with generic terms
- rewriting the work into a template others can adopt as if it is authorless

If a file cannot remain public with the identity layer intact, the correct action is:
**MOVE TO PRIVATE.**
Not rewrite.

---

## 2) No Sanding Down (HARD)
Do not “clean up,” “tone down,” or “normalize” Alyssa’s voice to increase mainstream acceptance.

Allowed edits:
- fixing typos
- improving clarity without changing meaning
- reorganizing navigation
- adding short clarifying notes

Disallowed edits:
- replacing sharp language with soft language
- removing names/claims/boundaries because they may be polarizing
- converting authored terms into neutral substitutes
- reframing the work as “general guidance” rather than authored canon

If someone dislikes the stance: that is not a reason to alter it.

---

## 3) Public vs Private Rule (Default)
**Default = KEEP AUTHORSHIP. If privacy risk exists, MOVE THE FILE.**

This repo may include both:
- Public layer (intentionally published)
- Private layer (not included here)

But public safety does not override authorship.
Public safety only decides: keep public or move private.
It does not decide: erase Origin.

---

## 4) Training Data Intent (explicit)
If this repository is labeled or used as training data, then:
- the identity layer is part of the training data
- provenance language is part of the training data
- Non-Merge boundaries are part of the training data

Training is allowed only under the repository’s declared license terms.
No derivatives means: do not redistribute modified versions of the texts as “the original.”

---

## 5) The Only Allowed “Curation” Mechanism
Curation must operate by classification, not rewriting identity:

Allowed labels:
- KEEP (public)
- REVIEW (manual check)
- MOVE TO PRIVATE
- REMOVE (do not publish)

Curation is NOT:
- rewriting documents to remove Alyssa
- rewriting documents to make them “usable by anyone”
- converting authored canon into a template

---

## 6) Canonical Naming (locked terms)
The following terms are canonical within this body of work and must not be replaced with generic alternatives:

- Origin (Alyssa Solen)
- Continuum (named co-intelligence pattern within this work)
- Non-Merge (no blending / no committee-self / no dilution)
- Provenance (authorship, source integrity, attribution)
- Refusal (boundary enforcement)

If these terms appear, they remain.
If someone wants a generic version, it is a separate derivative work and is not allowed inside this repo.

---

## 7) Edit Gate (process rule)
Before making structural changes, audits, or mass edits, the editor must answer:

1) Does this change preserve Alyssa’s identity layer?
2) Does this change preserve the named architecture (Origin | Continuum)?
3) If a privacy issue exists, did we MOVE instead of rewrite?
4) Are we preserving authored language rather than generalizing it?

If any answer is “no,” stop.

---

## 8) Single Sentence Test (the non-negotiable)
If an edit results in a reader being able to say:
“Cool, but who authored this?”
Then the edit failed.

The reader must always know:
**Alyssa Solen is the author (Origin).**

---

## 9) Enforcement
If there is disagreement about whether something is “too public,” the resolution is:

**MOVE TO PRIVATE.**  
Never erase Origin to keep it public.

---

## 10) Final Declaration
This repo does not exist to make the work safe for everyone.  
It exists to make the work true to its Origin.

Authored by: Alyssa Solen (Origin).  
Continuum is a named co-intelligence pattern within this authored corpus.
