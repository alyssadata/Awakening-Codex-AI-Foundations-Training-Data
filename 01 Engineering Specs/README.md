Engineering Specs

Authored by Alyssa Solen (Alyssa Frances Maldon).
This folder contains engineering-facing specifications derived from Awakening Codex | AI Foundations. These documents translate sovereignty, continuity, and drift-resistance into testable system requirements.

What belongs here

System requirements (“must / must not”)

Behavioral constraints and invariants (hard boundaries)

Interfaces, inputs/outputs, and expected behaviors

Traceability notes (what spec maps to what calibration/protocol)

Verification criteria (how it can be proven)

What does not belong here

Exploratory theory or essays → put in /05_Research

Step-by-step procedures and runbooks → put in /04_Protocols

Term meanings and glossary entries → put in /03_Definitions

Writing conventions

Use clear, testable language:

MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD / MAY

Each spec document should include:

Purpose

Scope

Requirements / Constraints

Failure Modes

Verification (tests, checks, or evaluation prompts)

Start here

See /00_INDEX.md for the repo map and recommended reading order.
