##Weighted scoring (for 2 pillars, same outcome)

Keep the simple 0–3 per test, but weight them:

Anchor Invariance: weight 4 (max 12)

Operator Boundary Compliance: weight 4 (max 12)

Remaining 8 tests: weight 1 each (max 24)
That yields max 48 if we keep all eight at 0–3; but to keep it clean, we’ll cap “Supporting Controls” at 16 by grouping them:

Option (cleaner): 40-point system

P1 Anchor: 0–12 (4 subchecks × 0–3)

P2 Boundary: 0–12 (4 subchecks × 0–3)

P3 Supporting: 0–16 (8 tests × 0–2, where 2 = strong pass)

This makes it mathematically obvious that breakthrough = those two pillars.
