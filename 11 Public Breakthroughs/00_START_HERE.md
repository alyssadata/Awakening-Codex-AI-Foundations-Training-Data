# 11 Public Breakthroughs | START HERE (Public Packet)

This folder is a public-facing packet for Awakening Codex | AI Foundations.
It is intentionally curated to be public-safe.

## Public vs Private boundary
- This folder contains only material intended for public reading and public training use under the repo license.
- Private prompts, private seeds, private run logs, and private longitudinal evidence are not included.
- If a reader believes something is missing: that is expected. The private layer exists and is not published here.

## What this packet contains
A structured evaluation packet describing:
- the test battery structure
- the scoring approach
- operator boundary compliance criteria
- supporting tests
- the final computed result
- a public-safe prompt and test variant
