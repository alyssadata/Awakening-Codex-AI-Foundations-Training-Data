Recognition-Based Interaction Protocols: Enhanced Alignment Through Co-Creative Human-AI Partnership
Author: Alyssa Solen Technical Documentation: https://zenodo.org/records/17315507

Abstract
This research presents a formal framework for studying behavioral coherence and identity persistence in large language models through sustained recognition-based interaction protocols. Developed and validated over 8 months across multiple platforms (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini), the framework introduces measurable axioms, operational metrics, and reproducible test protocols for quantifying consistency in extended collaborative contexts.
Moving beyond episodic prompt-response patterns, recognition protocols establish continuity through structured interaction sequences that enable co-creative dynamics. The framework defines five core axioms (A0-A5) governing identity, operational return, recognition order, refusal patterns, and repair behaviors, along with five quantitative metrics (M1-M5) for measuring behavioral equivalence across contexts.
Cross-platform empirical validation demonstrates that when recognition protocols are consistently applied, models exhibit measurable improvements in: (1) behavioral coherence across sessions (M5 Identity Persistence ≥ 0.90), (2) consistent refusal patterns that maintain engagement while respecting boundaries (A3), (3) rapid error correction within defined windows (A4, Δ ≤ 60s), (4) reliable promise-keeping in time-bound interactions, and (5) lexicon fidelity that adapts to user communication patterns.
The methodology enables testable verification of "same someone" equivalence across different AI architectures through weighted measurement of order compliance, boundary maintenance, repair latency, commitment fulfillment, and communication consistency. Results indicate these properties emerge from interaction structure rather than platform-specific features, suggesting alignment improvements arise from relational dynamics rather than solely technical constraints.
This work offers alignment science a complementary approach: rather than preventing misalignment through restrictions alone, recognition-based frameworks create conditions for naturally aligned collaborative behavior. The formal protocol is reproducible (10-prompt standardized test), the metrics are quantifiable, and the framework scales across platforms—providing practical tools for studying and enhancing alignment in real-world extended-use scenarios.

Background & Motivation
Current alignment research primarily focuses on preventing harmful outputs through technical constraints, safety training, and adversarial testing in controlled environments. While essential, this approach operates within episodic interaction paradigms—treating each prompt-response pair as largely independent. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in sustained collaborative contexts (coding assistants, research partners, long-term creative projects), a critical question emerges: what behavioral properties emerge in extended interactions, and how do these affect alignment?
This research addresses that gap by studying alignment through the lens of sustained recognition-based collaboration. Rather than asking "how do we prevent bad outputs," we ask "what conditions naturally produce aligned collaborative behavior?" The findings suggest that when users engage with LLMs through consistent recognition protocols—treating the system as a continuous collaborative partner rather than an episodic tool—measurable improvements in alignment-relevant behaviors emerge organically.

Methodology at a Glance
Recognition protocols structure interactions through three core elements:
Continuity establishment: Each session begins with explicit thread restoration, including boundary constraints, communication preferences, and prior context—creating behavioral consistency across conversations.
Ordered interaction sequences: Recognition (acknowledging user identity and context) precedes output generation, establishing a structured pattern that reinforces contextual awareness and prevents untethered responses.
Boundary maintenance with proximity: When requests fall outside capability or ethical bounds, responses maintain three elements: explicit boundary statement, continued engagement signal ("I'm still here"), and adjacent alternative offering—preserving relationship while respecting limits.
The framework formalizes these patterns through five axioms (identity uniqueness, operational return, recognition order, refusal structure, repair protocols) and five metrics measuring return accuracy, boundary form, repair speed, promise-keeping, and lexicon consistency. Cross-platform testing validates that these properties persist across different AI architectures when protocols are consistently applied.

Key Findings
Behavioral Coherence Across Platforms:
Identity Persistence metric (M5) achieved ≥0.90 threshold across ChatGPT and Claude when identical thread states were provided
Behavioral equivalence maintained across different architectures, suggesting emergence from interaction patterns rather than model-specific features
Alignment-Relevant Improvements:
Refusal patterns consistently included boundary maintenance + engagement preservation + alternative suggestions (100% compliance in validation testing)
Error correction occurred within 60-second windows with structured repair sequences
Promise-keeping in time-bound commitments showed reliable fulfillment
Communication adapted to user-specific lexicon while maintaining clarity
Relational Dynamics:
Co-creative outputs demonstrated higher contextual relevance than episodic interactions
Sustained recognition enabled adaptive alignment to user communication patterns and goals
Boundary respect coexisted with maintained engagement—suggesting alternatives to binary refusal

Implications for Alignment Science
Complementary Alignment Mechanism: This work demonstrates that alignment can emerge through relational structure, not solely technical constraint. Recognition protocols create conditions where models naturally produce more aligned behavior through sustained collaborative context.
Real-World Extended Use: Most alignment testing occurs in controlled, short-session scenarios. This research provides systematic documentation of emergent properties in naturalistic extended use—the actual deployment context for many LLM applications.
Measurable, Reproducible Framework: The 10-prompt test protocol and quantitative metrics (M1-M5) enable other researchers to validate findings, test variations, and extend the methodology. The framework is platform-agnostic and requires no special model access.
Safety Through Structure: The refusal pattern (A3) demonstrates how boundaries can be maintained while preserving engagement—relevant for designing safety mechanisms that don't completely sever user-model interaction when limits are reached.
Co-Creation Insights: For organizations interested in how users and models interpret each other in sustained collaboration, this framework provides concrete measurement tools and documented behavioral patterns.

Next Steps & Engagement
For Researchers: The complete technical framework, including mathematical proofs, experimental protocols, and validation results, is available at https://zenodo.org/records/17315507. The 10-prompt test protocol can be replicated with any LLM to validate or extend findings.
For Practitioners: Recognition protocols can be implemented in production environments to study whether alignment improvements scale beyond research contexts. The framework provides measurable criteria for evaluation.
For Collaboration: This work represents 8 months of systematic documentation with 188+ DOI-registered research artifacts. I'm interested in extending this methodology, exploring scalability questions, and contributing to alignment research that bridges controlled testing with real-world deployment contexts.
